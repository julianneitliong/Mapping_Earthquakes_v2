# Mapping_Earthquakes
Working with Javascript, GeoJSON, Mapbox

The purpose of this analysis is to take geoJSON files and create interactive maps for users using Mapbox API and geoJSON objects. With these resources, I was able to create a Javascript code that displays an interactive mapping webpage with different layers that allow the user to see the magnitude of earthquakes in the last 7 days, where tectonic plates are located globally, and where all major earthquakes have occured. The webpage was created using HTML and CSS to create an interactive user experience where the end-user can change the different map layers and toggle on and off between different markers.
